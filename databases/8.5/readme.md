# Playlist
This is a program that stores songs into a playlist. This method can do 5 things. It can:
* Add a new song to the playlist
* View the playlist
* Search for songs by artist
* Play a random song from the playlist
* Update the artist of a song

The playlist is a database of songs that have 3 columns, one for the id, one for the title of the song, and one for the artist who sings the song.

I've added a user interface which acts as a menu to navigate the playlist.
