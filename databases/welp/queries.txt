CHALLENGE 8.4 QUERIES

You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

input:
SELECT * 
  FROM users 
INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id 
INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

output:
1|Bradford|Pitt|1|3|great for annulments, so sad.|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|1|they impounded my prius|2|2|2|Amir's Towing
3|Angela|Jolie|3|5|there is actually a beagle there|3|3|3|The Beagle Nightclub

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

input:
SELECT users.firstname, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
	FROM users 
INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id 
INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

OUTPUT:
Bradford|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|great for annulments, so sad.
Mandy|Amir's Towing|1|they impounded my prius
Angela|The Beagle Nightclub|5|there is actually a beagle there

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

input:
SELECT * 
  FROM users 
INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id 
INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
WHERE businesses.id=2;

output:
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|1|they impounded my prius|2|2|2|Amir's Towing
