<!--
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to define the content of the page to it's purpose. They declare what each section is for. Ones that seem most useful are <main>, <nav>, <section>, and <article>. They seem most useful because those tags could be used to label the most important content of the webpage. 
The browser will display ther elements in the order they are written. 
I learned how to create custom snippets. You can name the trigger for the template anything you want and you can have anything added to the snippet, giving the template more than just the standard boilerplate. This is useful because it can save time from having to type out everything you want every single time a new document is started. I will definitely be using snippets in the future. 
I'm still having trouble grasping the idea of how to use semantic tags correctly, but in time, I know it will naturally come to me. I will improve just by gaining more experience and simply experimenting with them.
