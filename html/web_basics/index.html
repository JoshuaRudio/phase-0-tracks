<h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <h2>A webpage created by Joshua Rudio</h2>
  <h4>Preface:</h4>
  <p>What's up beautiful people?! This webpage was created on Monday April 3, 2017. This was created for the purpose of turning this in for Challenge 2.1 in Week 2 of Phase 0. It is very exciting to be finally diving into web development and although I have <em>very little</em> regarding html, I have quickly picked up the general idea of what it is as well as some of the syntax needed for this language.</p>
  <h4>Some things about me:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I am a first-generation immigrant from the Philippines</li>
      <li>I was born and raised in Seattle, WA.</li>
      <li>I grew up loving technology and, for the most part, am the most tech-savvy person of my social circles.</li>
      <li>I consider myself an avid gamer, hopefully here, I can gain the knowledge and experience to become a web developer and in the longrun, I would like to get into game development.</li>
    </ul>
