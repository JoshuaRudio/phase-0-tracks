# Git Definitions

##Release 2!!!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is something that allows multiple users to revise and add content to one single file. It also maintains the integrity of the main file (or master) by users making changes to duplicates (or clones) before the master owner reviews then merges changing into the master branch. This is useful because it enables an infinite number of users to edit a file while keeping the main file safe.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master branch that enables editing in a way doesn't affect the master. There can be any number of branches with different features but until it is manually added into the master branch, they can be altered in any way.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point. When you are finished editing the files of the repository, using a commit is how you collectively save all the changes made, and then post a message. Any changes must first be added to git. Or else they won't be included in the save point, the commit. The message of the commit is typically a short description of what changes to the branch were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when there is a difference between branches. You can not have a branch merge into the master if there is a discrepancy in the codes of the branches. The conflict can be resolved by making sure the branches match before merging.
