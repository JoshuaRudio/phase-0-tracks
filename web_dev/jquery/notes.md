# The Plan to Learn jQuery
* I will spend the first hour on Codecademy
* 15 minutes on YouTube looking for more tutorials
* 15 minutes looking up jQuery docs, if any.
* 30 minutes playing around with jQuery myself
I plan to take 5 minute breaks every 30 minutes or so.
# Summary
I found my strategy rather useful and I learned the most from an hour long video on YouTube from Derek Banas. He had timestamps on the video so I watched the portions of the video that wasn't covered too much in codecademy.
