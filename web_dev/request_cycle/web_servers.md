**What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?**

After researching for about 30 minutes on the key design philiosophies, I've learned that the creators took a 'By the people, for the people approach.' in making the operating system. 
One of the biggest philosophies is that Linux is distributed with an open source license and that it is free. This gives users the freedom to use it as they see fit and the ability to learn as much of the program they can and make changes. 
It is apparent that the creators of Linux wanted to make something that is available to any and everyone. They even come with different "flavors" or distributions that give users the GUI of their choosing. Linux gives users the freedom to truly make their computer their own.

**In your own words, what is a VPS? What according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?**

A VPS is a computer you pay someone to use to run your programs and host your websites from. It is an imaginary computer that exists on the hardware of the hosting company. 
From there, you may install Linux as your operating system, retrieve a repository, and open a port to turn the imaginary computer into a server. 
An advantage to VPS is cost. The price of a VPS compared to a physical server is immensily lower, however, the activity of other servers on the physical hardware may reduce performance.
